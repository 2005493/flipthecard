# Memory Card Game
Welcome to the Memory Card Game repository! This project is a simple and interactive memory card game built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. It challenges players to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. The game features a clean, responsive design and a smooth user experience, leveraging modern web technologies.


## Features

- Card Flipping Mechanism: Cards can be flipped to reveal their values. The game keeps track of two cards simultaneously to determine if they form a matching pair.
- Visual Feedback: When a player clicks a card, it flips to reveal the number. If two flipped cards match, they stay revealed; otherwise, they flip back after a short delay.
- Game Logic: Implemented in vanilla JavaScript, the game logic handles card comparisons, flipping animations, and tracking matched pairs.
- Transition Effects: Smooth transition effects are applied using Tailwind CSS classes for flipping and scaling animations, providing visual feedback for user interactions.
- Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the game is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
